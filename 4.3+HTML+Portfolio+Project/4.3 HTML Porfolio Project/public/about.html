        <p>Hello! My name is Adam Walczuk, and I am a beginner web developer. I am passionate about creating websites and web applications. My goal is to continually improve my skills and learn new technologies with God's help.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the future, I plan to expand my knowledge to frameworks like React and Angular. I believe that through hard work and God's support, I can achieve my goals and become a professional web developer.</p>
        <p>Apart from programming, I am also interested in music, traveling, and sports. I love discovering new places and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
